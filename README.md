# HttpeFileServer
This assignment is done as part of the course "Computer Networks and Protocols". Here I have created my own http file sever which can run at a given port in a given directory on a system. It is capable of handling GET and POST requests from http clients and respond to them. This file server can also handle some http headers like content-type and content-disposition.
